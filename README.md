## About Me

Graduate student at **Université Moulay Ismail, Faculté des Sciences (Meknes)** pursuing a Master's in **IoT Intelligence & Security**. My work spans the full stack of intelligent embedded systems—from bare-metal ARM programming and OS porting to deep learning model deployment and security analysis.

I build things from scratch: custom RTOS compatibility layers, Linux kernels for ARM architectures, mobile applications with LLM inference, neural networks for audio forensics, and intrusion detection systems for IoT protocols. The work is practical, technically deep, and often incomplete—because real engineering is about exploration, not polished demos.

**Technical Focus Areas:**
- **Embedded Systems Engineering:** RTOS porting (mbed OS on ESP32), bare-metal ARM development, Linux from scratch for ARM
- **AI/ML Systems:** Deep learning (RNNs, Transformers), voice manipulation detection, predictive modeling, LLM integration
- **Mobile Development:** Android applications (Java), on-device AI inference, expense tracking with category prediction
- **Security Research:** IoT protocol analysis, network intrusion detection, reverse engineering, binary exploitation

## Project Domains

My repository is a snapshot of ongoing technical exploration across multiple engineering disciplines. Projects range from complete production systems to experimental prototypes—many remain unfinished because learning the fundamentals is often more valuable than polishing a demo.

### 🔌 Embedded Systems & RTOS Engineering
Custom operating system ports, bare-metal firmware, and industrial protocol implementations. Includes mbed OS 5 API compatibility layer for ESP32 (complete multi-threaded data logger with Modbus RTU), sensor network development, and Linux kernel builds for ARM architectures.

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning
Neural network development for real-world problems: voice manipulation detection using RNNs and Transformer models, sports outcome prediction with statistical ML, and LLM integration for intelligent mobile applications.

### 📱 Mobile Application Development
Android applications built in pure Java: expense tracking systems with DeepSeek LLM integration for automatic category prediction, data visualization using chart libraries, and local database management.

### 🛡️ Security Research & Tooling
Offensive and defensive security work: intrusion detection systems for IoT protocols (MQTT, HTTP), malware reverse engineering and binary analysis, network penetration testing, email header forensics tools, and vulnerability research.

### 🔬 Systems Programming & Compiler Design
Low-level software engineering: custom lexers and parsers for language implementation, compiler theory applications, and systems-level abstractions.
